The story begins when I tried to install KDE neon on my working desktop on Ubuntu16.04, it complained with multiple errors since then. So I choose to rebuild a Kubuntu18.04 with dual-boot with the current system. And I have to work it for such a long time since the new environment is just building.

And something interesting happened, I can never open the terminal ever since I installed KDE neon. I thought as though it complains a lot, even annoying, it doesn't matter if it works, and it works for Chrome and VSCode.
