My strong suspicion is we get the world we deserve. 'Coz we don't believe what we see, we see what we believe.

Especially I'm not intelligent or athletic, I'm lazy and envy.

But I think I'm happy. I like coding and cycling. I like poems and novels. Thanks god even life is boring the world is interesting.

And thanks you for reading!
